- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m George William Scriven, welcome to my GitHub page! Here you will find my doodles and bits of code I've written during my degree and in my free time awell as notes from course and work I'm particularly proud of! A little about me:
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Quantum Physics, Mathematics and Finance, I'll be studying quantum technologies for the next year at UCL, after that I'd love to get into work or a PhD, we will see how things go.
